# About me

I am a Ph.D. candidate at RWTH Aachen in the field of High Energy Physics, where my focus is on data analysis from the CMS experiment.

Currently, my primary projects involve:

Correction of Simulation Mis-modeling: The CMS detector is a complex machine, and simulations of physical processes cannot account for everything that occurs within the detector. I am dedicated to correcting simulation inaccuracies to enhance the alignment with the observed data. To achieve this, we are employing auto-regressive neural spline flows.

Early Run3 Higgs to gamma gamma Effort: I actively contribute to the development of the analysis framework HiggsDNA, a novel framework that fully utilizes columnar analysis for the Early Run3 Higgs to gamma gamma effort.

Photon Pair Classification Project: In the Run2 analysis, the photon pair mass resolution was categorized. Currently, we are exploring the possibility of using an alternative categorization method, such as an MVAID. We are evaluating the potential improvement that a simple Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) can bring to our analysis. If the results prove promising, we plan to incorporate more low-input variables, so we can use more powerfull techniques like graphs or transformers.
