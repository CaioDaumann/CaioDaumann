# About me

I am a PhD candidate at RWTH Aachen in the High Energy physics area, where I work with data analysis from the CMS experiment.

I am working my biggest projects at the moment are:

Corrections of simulation mis modeling. The CMS detector is a very complicated machine, and the simulations of the physical processes cannot accounted for eveything that happens in the detector. 
I am working in corrections of the simulation to better match the data we observe. for that we are emploing auto regressive neural spline flows.

I also take part in the Early Run3 Higgs to gamma gamma effort, where I work in the development of the analysis framework HiggsDNA a new framework that fully uses colunar analysis. 

My other project is related to the classification of photon pairs. In the run2 analysis, a categorization in the mass resolution of the photon pair was made. We are exploring the possibiity of 
using another type of categorization, such as a mvaID. At the moment we are evalauting how much improvement a simple BDT can bring to us. If the results are prommising we plan to start using more low input variables.
