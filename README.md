# About me

I am a Ph.D. candidate at RWTH Aachen in the field of High Energy Physics, where my focus is on data analysis from the CMS experiment.

Currently, my primary projects involve:

Correction of Simulation Mis-modeling: The CMS detector is a complex machine, and simulations of physical processes cannot account for everything that occurs within the detector. I am dedicated to correcting simulation inaccuracies to enhance the alignment with the observed data. To achieve this, we are employing conditional auto-regressive neural spline flows. 

Early Run3 Higgs to gamma gamma Effort: I actively contribute to the development of the analysis framework HiggsDNA, a novel framework that fully utilizes columnar analysis for the Early Run3 Higgs to gamma gamma effort. (https://gitlab.cern.ch/HiggsDNA-project/HiggsDNA)

Photon Pair Classification Project: In the Run2 analysis, the photon pair mass resolution was used to categoriza the analysis. Currently, we are exploring the possibility of using an alternative categorization method, such as an MVAID. We are evaluating the potential improvement that a simple Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) can bring to the categorization of our analysis. If the results prove promising, we plan to incorporate more low-input variables, so we can use more powerfull techniques like graphs or transformers.

I have recently joined the AutoDQM (Data Quality Management) team. AutoDQM functions as a tool designed for analyzing the performance of detectors within the CMS experiment. It employs anomaly detection algorithms, such as the beta-binomial statistical test, principal component analysis, and autoencoders, to identify anomalies in the detectors. The detected anomalies are flagged, enabling prompt resolution of issues and appropriate identification of data collected during detector malfunctions.
